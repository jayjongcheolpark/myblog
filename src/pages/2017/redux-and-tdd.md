# Redux

I read the article about Redux on [Medium](https://www.medium.com). Sometimes I find incredible articles. These articles are also helpful to understand the basic of Redux.

[TLTR; Redux - Nick Tsourektsides](https://medium.com/@nicotsou/tltr-redux-e4fc30f87e4a): I haven't yet used redux-tool-extension. It looks very useful to analyze Redux state and state mutation.

[When do I know I’m ready for Redux? - Simon Schwartz](https://medium.com/dailyjs/when-do-i-know-im-ready-for-redux-f34da253c85f): Bunch of GIFs are awesome to explain how Redux works.

## TDD (Test Driven Development)

Nowadays, I am interested in TDD. Most developers don't like to write the test code. It spends so much time. But testing makes service more stable. So, I am finding the way to test React application. Mocha looks like classic testing tool. Facebook made Jest and Airbnb made Enzyme. They have some common ways to test Components and some different ways also. I will study TDD more with those tools.
